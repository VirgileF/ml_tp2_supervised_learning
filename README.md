# ml_tp2_supervised_learning

Introduction to end-to-end supervised learning projects divided into three parts:
- Feature engineering and KNN (cf. part1_feature_engineering_and_knn.ipynb)
- Heterogeous data issues (cf. part2_heterogegeous_data.ipynb)
- Text mining and classification (cf. part3_text_mining_and_classification.ipynb)
